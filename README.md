Welcome to the **Pokemon-Battle-Arena.**
This is a project I built because I wanted to see what happens when you mix my love for Pokémon with the power of Python and Streamlit. 
It’s not just a stat checker—it’s a full battle experience!
## What does this app do?
Have you ever wondered if a Pikachu could actually take on a Lucario based purely on their base stats?
This app lets you settle those debates.
It pulls live data from the **PokeAPI**, calculates the "Power Quotient" of two Pokémon, and declares a winner in a high-stakes arena.

## Features
1. Real-Time Data
2. Dynamic Audio System
3. Sleek Battle UI
4. Modular Architecture

## 🚀 Want to try it yourself?
